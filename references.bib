  abstract={Creating suitable chemical categories and developing read-across methods, supported by quantum mechanical calculations, can be an effective solution to solving key problems related to current scarcity of data on the toxicity of various nanoparticles. This study has demonstrated that by applying a nano-read-across, the cytotoxicity of nano-sized metal oxides could be estimated with a similar level of accuracy as provided by quantitative structure-activity relationship for nanomaterials (nano-QSAR model(s)). The method presented is a suitable computational tool for the preliminary hazard assessment of nanomaterials. It also could be used for the identification of nanomaterials that may pose potential negative impact to human health and the environment. Such approaches are especially necessary when there is paucity of relevant and reliable data points to develop and validate nano-QSAR models.}

abstract  ="The number and variety of engineered nanoparticles have been growing exponentially. Since the experimental evaluation of nanoparticles causing public health concerns is expensive and time consuming{,} efficient computational tools are amongst the most suitable approaches to identifying potential negative impacts{,} to the human health and the environment{,} of new nanomaterials before their production. However{,} developing computational models complimentary to experiments is impossible without incorporating consistent and high quality experimental data. Although there are limited available data in the literature{,} one may apply read-across techniques that seem to be an attractive and pragmatic alternative way of predicting missing physico-chemical or toxicological data. Unfortunately{,} the existing methods of read-across are strongly dependent on the expert{'}s knowledge. In consequence{,} the results of estimations may vary dependently on personal experience of expert conducting the study and as such cannot guarantee the reproducibility of their results. Therefore{,} it is essential to develop novel read-across algorithm(s) that will provide reliable predictions of the missing data without the need to for additional experiments. We proposed a novel quantitative read-across approach for nanomaterials (Nano-QRA) that addresses and overcomes a basic limitation of existing methods. It is based on: one-point-slope{,} two-point formula{,} or the equation of a plane passing through three points. The proposed Nano-QRA approach is a simple and effective algorithm for filling data gaps in quantitative manner providing reliable predictions of the missing data."}

ABSTRACT = {Analyzing chemical datasets is a challenging task for scientific researchers in the field of chemoinformatics. It is important, yet difficult to understand the relationship between the structure of chemical compounds, their physico-chemical properties, and biological or toxic effects. To that respect, visualization tools can help to better comprehend the underlying correlations. Our recently developed 3D molecular viewer CheS-Mapper (Chemical Space Mapper) divides large datasets into clusters of similar compounds and consequently arranges them in 3D space, such that their spatial proximity reflects their similarity. The user can indirectly determine similarity, by selecting which features to employ in the process. The tool can use and calculate different kind of features, like structural fragments as well as quantitative chemical descriptors. These features can be highlighted within CheS-Mapper, which aids the chemist to better understand patterns and regularities and relate the observations to established scientific knowledge. As a final function, the tool can also be used to select and export specific subsets of a given dataset for further analysis.},

Here we investigate{,} based on an extensive gold NPs protein corona dataset{,} the relationships between NP-cell association and protein corona fingerprints (PCFs) as well as NP physicochemical properties. Accordingly{,} quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) were developed based on both linear and non-linear support vector regression (SVR) models making use of a sequential forward floating selection of descriptors. The SVR model with only 6 serum proteins and zeta potential had higher accuracy (R2 = 0.895) relative to the linear model (R2 = 0.850) with 11 PCFs. Considering the initial pool of 148 descriptors{,} the APOB{,} A1AT{,} ANT3{,} and PLMN serum proteins along with NP zeta potential were identified as most significant to correlating NP-cell association. The present study suggests that QSARs exploration of NP-cell association data{,} considering the role of both NP protein corona and physicochemical properties{,} can support the planning and interpretation of toxicity studies and guide the design of NPs for biomedical applications."}
